# I Can't Listen Right Now: Enhancing Voice Messages with Pop-up Text and Emojis

## Overview
**"I Can't Listen Right Now"** is a research project exploring novel ways to enhance **mobile voice messaging** by integrating **text highlights and emojis**. The goal is to **improve message comprehension and usability** while maintaining the convenience of voice messages.

## Problem Statement
- **Voice messages are convenient** but suffer from **low comprehension** in certain contexts.
- There is no seamless way to **combine the benefits of voice and text**.
- This research introduces two novel approaches to **enhance mobile communication**.

## Research Question
*"How do two novel approaches for mobile communication, one combining text and voice, and the other combining emojis and voice, compare in comprehension and usability scores?"*

## Proposed Solutions
1️⃣ **Voice & Text** – Highlights important words from voice messages as **pop-up text**.  
2️⃣ **Voice & Emojis** – Highlights key words using **emojis** to enhance interpretation.

## Hypotheses
✔ **Usability**: The novel approaches will be deemed **acceptable** by users.  
✔ **Comprehension**: Voice + text and voice + emoji will outperform standard voice messages.  
✔ **User Preference**: Users will prefer the novel approaches over traditional voice messages.  

## Methodology
- **Three experimental groups**:
  - **Control Group** – Listens to conventional voice messages.
  - **Group 2** – Uses voice messages with **pop-up text** for key words.
  - **Group 3** – Uses voice messages with **emojis** for key words.
- **Data Collection**:
  - **System Usability Scale (SUS)** scores.
  - **Comprehension questionnaire** responses.
  - **66 participants** (ages 18-74, mixed gender, diverse language fluency).
  - **Realistic video-based experiment** using modified voice messages.

## Results & Findings
**Comprehension**:
- Novel approaches **did not significantly surpass conventional voice messages**.
- Traditional voice messages remained **highly effective**, but **pop-up text and emojis showed potential**.

**Usability**:
- **Novel approaches were considered acceptable** but **not significantly better** than conventional voice messages.
- Voice messages had the **highest comprehension scores but lowest usability scores**.
